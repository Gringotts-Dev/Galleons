# Galleons

The Worlds First Online Wizarding Currency
==========================================
[Galleons Is An ERC20 Token Based On The Ethereum Network]

The Goblins at Gringotts have taken it upon themselves to create the first wizarding currency online, 
However, due to their lack of creativity they could think of no other name but Galleons.

Galleons have been created by previous and current Gringotts employees, 
who have sought to utilise this Muggle-magic called 'block-chain', 
In the hopes that is may bring a whole new era in which wizards may have the convenience of 'Online Shoping' 
such as the Muggles, and that they to can transfer value seamlessly.

Galleons are intended to allow the wizarding community to, for the first time ever, transfer value online.
It is the worlds first Onine Wizarding Currency and it is the first Wizarding Currency that is immune to the Gemino Curse.

Have you ever run out of ingredients when brewing up a Hiccoughing Potion,
or broken your wand when crashing into a whomping willow ? Never again!
With the new Galleons built on top of this strange magic, 
wizards can now conveniently fill their bags with all sorts of items from stores 'Online'.

The eager merchant wizard can be assured that all the Galleons they receive are 100% Leprechaun gold free,
and the client can rest assured knowing their funds can not be stolen when the next dark lord rises.


Serious
=======
Galleons were solely created for fun. With the intent to increase the role-play experience.
Galleons are not supposed to be a real representation of value.
This project was also created to show people something they love and then to use that to help
ease them into this new world of 'Crypto Currencies'.
Use them for fun and use them lightheartedly.
